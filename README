DESCRIPTION:
        This program's purpose is to allocate memory in a variety of ways. We use different algorithms
        to complete the memory allocation. Algorithms displayed in this program include: Bestfit, Nextfit,
        Firstfit, and Buddy. Bestfit works by checking the whole block to find either the exact size of
        free memory available equal to the incoming process, or the closest size to it and inserting the
        process there. Nextfit keeps track of where the previous process was allocated, and finds the
        next available space with enough size and allocates the process there. Firstfit works by scanning
        through the block and finding the first space available that can fit the process and allocating
        it there. The Buddy system works by, theoretically, splitting the block in two, and thinking of
        it as two halves. From there, memory is stored by powers of 2 that can hold the whole process
        size.
